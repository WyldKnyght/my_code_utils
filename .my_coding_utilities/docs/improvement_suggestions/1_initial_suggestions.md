Your current project structure and documentation drafts look well-organized and follow good practices for Python project management. Here are some observations and suggestions based on your current setup:

## Project Structure

Your folder structure is organized logically, with separate directories for utilities, documentation, and source code. This separation allows for easy maintenance and scalability. However, consider the following adjustments:

1. Move the `.my_coding_utilities` folder to `src/utils` to align with the default folder structure you've defined[1].
- These codes are meant to be used during the developmnent process and are not meant to be used in production.
- If specific codes are required to be used in production, then they should be moved to the `src/utils` folder.
2. Create a `tests` directory at the root level for unit and integration tests[6].
- Actioned
3. Consider adding a `data` folder at the root level for SQLite databases and schema files, as mentioned in your default folder structure[1].
- Actioned

## Documentation

Your documentation covers essential aspects such as system setup, default folder structure, and coding principles. To enhance it further:

1. Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to guide potential contributors[6].
- Actioned
2. Add inline documentation to your Python files using docstrings[6].
3. Consider using a tool like Sphinx to generate comprehensive documentation from your docstrings[6].
- Installed Sphinx, added note to coding_principles doc

## Coding Principles

Your coding principles are solid and align well with best practices in Python development. To further improve:

1. Consider adding a principle about writing unit tests for all new code[6].
2. Include a guideline about using type hints to improve code readability and catch potential errors early[1].
3. Add a principle about following PEP 8 style guidelines for consistent code formatting[6].

## Utility Organization

For organizing your utility functions:

1. Group related utility functions into modules within the `utils` directory[5].
2. Use `__init__.py` files to control what's exposed from each module[1].
3. Consider using a tool like `importanize` to organize your imports consistently[7].

## Next Steps

1. Implement the suggested changes to your folder structure.
2. Expand your documentation, especially for individual utilities.
3. Set up a virtual environment and update your `requirements.txt` file with all necessary dependencies[6].
4. Start adding unit tests for your utility functions in the `tests` directory.
5. Consider setting up continuous integration (CI) to automatically run tests and check code quality on each commit[6].

Your current setup provides a solid foundation for your coding utilities project. By implementing these suggestions, you'll further improve its organization, maintainability, and usability.
