Your approach to organizing your coding utilities outside of the `src` folder makes sense, as these utilities are intended to assist in the development process rather than being part of the project's source code. Here are some insights and suggestions based on your setup:

## Utility Organization

1. **Separation from Source Code**: By keeping these utilities separate from the `src` folder, you maintain a clear distinction between project-specific code and development tools. This is similar to how infrastructure-as-code (IaC) configurations are often kept separate from application source code[2].

2. **Utility Structure**: Your current structure with `.my_coding_utilities` containing specific utility folders (e.g., `create_db_from_schema`) is logical. Consider organizing utilities into categories (e.g., database, file management, project setup) if you have many.

3. **Documentation**: Ensure that each utility has its own documentation or README file explaining its purpose, usage, and any dependencies. This will help you and others understand how to use these tools effectively.

## Best Practices for Reusing Code

1. **Modularity**: If some utilities are reusable across projects, consider creating a separate repository for them. This allows you to maintain and update these utilities independently without affecting specific projects[4][5].

2. **Monorepo vs. Multi-Repo**: Depending on the scale and complexity of your utilities, you might opt for a monorepo (a single repository for all utilities) or a multi-repo approach (separate repositories for different categories of utilities). Monorepos can simplify code sharing and collaboration, while multi-repos provide better isolation between projects[6][7].

3. **Versioning and Testing**: Implement versioning for your utilities and include tests to ensure they work as expected across different environments and projects.

## Next Steps

1. **Expand Documentation**: Enhance the documentation for each utility to include examples and troubleshooting tips.
2. **Automate Testing**: Set up automated tests for your utilities to catch any regressions.
3. **Consider a Monorepo or Multi-Repo Strategy**: Depending on the growth of your utilities collection, evaluate whether a monorepo or multi-repo strategy would be more beneficial for maintenance and collaboration.

By following these guidelines, you can maintain a well-organized and efficient set of coding utilities that support your development workflow effectively.
